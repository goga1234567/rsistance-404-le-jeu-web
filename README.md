## AI Task: Complete README Transformation

Hello Cursor AI! Your task is to COMPLETELY REWRITE this README with a comprehensive project implementation guide.

### Critical Requirements:

1. **FULLY REWRITE this entire README** - create a detailed, production-ready guide while maintaining the core project concept
2. **Create a DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PLAN (max 8 steps)** that covers:
   - Environment setup with all required technologies
   - Project structure creation
   - Implementation of core features
   - Testing and deployment approaches
3. **Tailor content to the user's profile:**
   - User's Experience Level: `Beginner`
   - User's Available Time: `A Few Hours`
4. **For each technology listed**, provide:
   - Specific implementation details
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
5. **Add detailed sections for:**
   - Architecture diagram or description
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Component structure (for frontend)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment instructions
6. **Provide code examples** for critical project parts
7. **REMOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY** after your rewrite

Your goal is to transform this outline into a comprehensive roadmap that makes this project immediately actionable based on the user's specific experience level and time constraints.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIRST STEP ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOUR FIRST AND ONLY TASK UPON RECEIVING THIS README IS TO REWRITE IT COMPLETELY. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT OR WRITING ANY CODE YET.**

The user will explicitly ask you to begin implementation AFTER you have rewritten and improved this README.

# R√©sistance 404: Le Jeu Web

## Project Overview
Create an interactive web-based game where the player takes on the role of Agent_One, tasked with infiltrating corrupted websites, exploiting vulnerabilities, and restoring ancient protocols to defeat the AI Sovereign404 and reclaim the free web.


> **üí° Quick Start:** After cloning this repository and opening it in Cursor, simply tell the AI: "Read the README and guide me through implementing this project step by step." Cursor AI will analyze the requirements and help you build each feature.


## User Profile
- **Experience Level:** Beginner
- **Available Time to Complete:** A Few Hours

## Technologies
- **HTML5**: Used for creating the game's interactive interface, including terminal-style animations and glitch effects.
- **CSS3**: Utilized for styling the terminal interface, creating animations, and achieving a retro aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Employed for creating the command parser, interactive puzzles, and handling game logic.
- **WebStorage**: Used to store game states between sessions, allowing players to pick up where they left off.


## Development Steps
### 1. Setup the Terminal Interface
Create the basic terminal interface using HTML5 and CSS3, incorporating animations and glitch effects.

### 2. Implement Command Parsing
Write JavaScript code to parse user input, allowing players to use commands like 'scan', 'inject', and 'decrypt'.

### 3. Create Corrupted Website Mocks
Design and implement interactive website mocks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, simulating the experience of exploring corrupted sites.

### 4. Develop Combat Mechanics
Design and implement combat mechanics, where enemies are represented as firewalls, captchas, and glitched bots, requiring players to use logic and timing to overcome.

### 5. Implement Navigation and Exploration
Write code to enable players to navigate through the corrupted websites, using commands and solving puzzles to progress.

### 6. Add Sound Effects (Optional)
Use JavaScript to create glitch loops, CRT effects, and modem sounds, enhancing the game's ambiance and immersion.

### 7. Integrate WebStorage for Session Persistence
Implement WebStorage to store game states, allowing players to resume their progress between sessions.


## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet
function parseCommand(input) {
  // Command parsing logic here
  return 'Command parsed successfully';
}
```


## Getting Started
Instructions will be added soon

## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Create a basic HTML structure for the game's terminal-style interface, including a `<div>` element with an ID of 'terminal', and link it to a CSS file that styles the interface with a retro aesthetic. Use JavaScript to add an event listener to the 'terminal' div, allowing players to input commands and triggering the `parseCommand` function.
```

### Prompt 2
```
Implement the `parseCommand` function to parse player input, checking for valid commands and executing corresponding actions. For example, the function could check for commands like 'cd', 'ls', and 'exploit', and respond accordingly. Use WebStorage to store the game state and allow players to pick up where they left off. 
```

### Prompt 3
```
Enhance the game by adding interactive puzzles and challenges that require players to use their skills to infiltrate corrupted websites. Utilize JavaScript's ability to create animations and glitch effects, and incorporate WebStorage to store player progress and achievements.
```


Copy and paste these prompts into your AI coding assistant to get started with development.
